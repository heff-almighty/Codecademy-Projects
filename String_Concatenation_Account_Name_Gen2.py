Copelandâ€™s Corporate Company also wants to update how they generate temporary passwords for new employees.

Write a function called password_generator() that takes two inputs, first_name and last_name, and then concatenates 
the last three letters of each and returns them as a string.

Test your function on the provided first_name and last_name and save it to the variable temp_password.
