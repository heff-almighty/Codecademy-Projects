#DIV BY 10

  #GREETINGS
  
#Define the function to accept a list of strings as a single parameter called names

#Delete Starting Even Numbers

#Define our function to accept a single input parameter lst which is a list of numbers
#Loop through every number in the list if there are still numbers in the list and if we havenâ€™t hit an odd number yet

#ODD INDICES
 
#Define the function header to accept one input which will be our list of numbers
#Create a new list which will hold our values to return
#Iterate through every odd index until the end of the list

#Exponents

#Define the function to accept two lists of numbers, bases and powers
#Create a new list that will contain our answers
#Create a loop that iterates through every base in bases
#Within that loop, create another loop that iterates through every power in power
#Within that nested loop, append the result of the current base raised to the current power.
#After all iterations of both loops are complete, return the list of answers
